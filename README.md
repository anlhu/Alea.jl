# Arithmetic in Alea.jl

[![Unit Tests](https://github.com/Juice-jl/Dice.jl/workflows/Unit%20Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Juice-jl/Dice.jl/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Unit+Tests%22+branch%3Amain)  [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Tractables/Dice.jl/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/Tractables/Dice.jl)

This branch contains the Julia prototype implementation of the [Dice](https://github.com/SHoltzen/dice) probabilistic programming language for the UAI 2023 paper  ["Scaling Integer Arithmetic in Probabilistic Programs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13837). This branch also contains the code used for each experiment:

* The microbenchmarks (Figure 5) are in `experiments/microbenchmarks/`
* The experiments (Table 1) are in `experiments/models/`

Additional instructions for recreating the experiments are contained in these folders.

 **TODO: add instructions**

 To properly setup `Alea.jl`,  follow the instructions below. For the most up-to-date version, go to the `main` branch.  

## Setup Instructions

Install Julia 1.7 or higher using [these instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/).

Clone the repository and start julia in project mode for current folder:
```bash
cd Alea.jl
julia --project
```

Install Alea and update dependencies (one can also use `precompile` or `build`):

```
] up
```

Press CTRL-C or backspace to exit from the pkg terminal and return to Julia REPL.

One can now run a program from the Julia REPL:
```julia
include("examples/graph_reachability.jl")
```

Or from the command line:
```
julia --project examples/graph_reachability.jl
```
